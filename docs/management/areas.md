## Areas

These are the following areas for the products:

- Applications => These are products used by an end-user directly:
    - Web => These are applications that users use while connecting to a website (aka webapps);
    - Desktop => These are applications that users use while in the desktop;
    - Console => These are applications that users use while working on a console or command prompt;
        - Server => These are applications that users use as a server (eg. FTP server);
    - Mobile => These are applications that users use on a mobile device (eg. Smartphone or Tablet);
- Infrastructure => These are products used to manage infrastruture;
- Libraries => These are products used by other developers to develop other libraries or applications.

The area of a product is represented by a urn in the form:

- `urn:software:application` => For an application;
- `urn:software:application:web` => For a web application;
- `urn:software:application:desktop` => For a desktop application;
- `urn:software:application:console` => For a console application;
- `urn:software:application:console:server` => For a server application;
- `urn:software:application:mobile` => For a mobile application;
- `urn:software:infrastructure` => For a infrastructure product;
- `urn:software:libraries` => For a library;
