This space contains stuff related to the management of chordflower, like:

- [A deeper description of what is a product](./product.md)
- [A description of the product taxonomies](./taxonomies.md);
- [A description of the various product areas and categories](./areas.md);
- [A description of the various product states](./states.md);
- [A description of the various tools used](./tools.md);
- [A description of the workflows used by several tools](./workflows.md).

But before, we go there a quick clarification of concepts:

- Product => This is what chordflower has and can be used by an user;
- Project => These are steps used to implement products or features inside products, they have a **finite** time span (emphasis on finite).
