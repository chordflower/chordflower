# Values

This page describes some of the values of ChordFlower, that are inspired in programming and internet culture.

## General Values

Taken from the rules of the internet:

- We are Anonymous.
- Anonymous is legion.
- Anonymous does not forgive, Anonymous does not forget.
- Anonymous can be horrible, senseless, uncaring monster.
- Lurk moar — it's never enough.
- Do not argue with a troll — it means that they win.
- The more you hate it, the stronger it gets.
- There will always be more screwed up stuff than what you just saw.
- Anything you say can and will be used against you.
- The harder you try, the harder you will fail.
- The more beautiful and pure a thing is — the more satisfying it is to corrupt it.

Taken from somewhere else:

- Reality beats ideology everytime.
- Cunning sometimes beats brute force.
- Just because someone seems arrogant it does not mean it is.
- Sometimes its better if you cry, than if I cry.

## Programming Rules

Taken from various sources:

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Concurrency is not parallelism.
- Errors are values.
- Don't just check errors, handle them gracefully.
- Documentation is for users.
- Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.
-  Rule of Separation: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.
- Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.
- Rule of Generation: Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can.
- Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.
- Do one thing and do it well.
- Smart data-structures and dumb algorithms works a lot better than the other way around.
